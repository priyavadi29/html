		<h2>Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class</h2>
			<p>
				For the 2017 model year (late 2016), with the release of the third generation R172 facelift, the SLK-Class will be renamed to Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class in accordance with the revised nomenclature adopted by the brand. Under this scheme, roadsters use the base name "SL", followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy. The "SL" is for Sportlich Leicht (German for "Sport Light") and alludes to the long-running SL-Class. This is followed by the letter "C"â€”the SLC being the roadster equivalent to the C-Class.[3][4]

					For the best possible visibility on country roads and motorways, when cornering and on bends, the low beam mode of the LED Intelligent Light System automatically adapts to the weather, lighting and driving conditions. The LED Intelligent Light System thus makes a key contribution to safe driving. 
					Their brief is to think globally, to nurture cultural exchange, to conduct trend research and to act as ambassadors for Daimler Design. The Advanced Exterior Design Studios are located in Sindelfingen (Germany), Beijing and Sunnyvale. Sindelfingen is where the threads from all the studios run together, where committees present their designs and models to measure themselves against their in-house design competitors.
