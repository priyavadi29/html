		<h2>Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class</h2>
			<p>
				For the 2017 model year (late 2016), with the release of the third generation R172 facelift, the SLK-Class will be renamed to Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class in accordance with the revised nomenclature adopted by the brand. Under this scheme, roadsters use the base name "SL", followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy. The "SL" is for Sportlich Leicht (German for "Sport Light") and alludes to the long-running SL-Class. This is followed by the letter "C"â€”the SLC being the roadster equivalent to the C-Class.[3][4]
